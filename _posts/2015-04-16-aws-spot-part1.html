If you have ever used any cloud service, then chances are pretty good that it was AWS. They lead the way with almost 1/3rd of the cloud infrastructure market (<a href="http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2015/feb/03/aws-hits-five-year-high-cloud-infrastructure-market-share/" target="_blank">source</a>). Worldwide more and more professionals are using AWS’s EC2 instances because they are dependable, flexible & easy to manage.
<br><br>But all that comes at a cost, which companies realize soon enough. Because when you grow, your EC2 bill grows with you. I had already heard stories of large bills before experiencing this myself. And when it happened to me, it made me stop and ask some questions.
<br><br>What are your options when the AWS EC2 bills start growing too much, too fast? Do you: 
<br>a)	Move to another cloud service?
<br>b)	Move to DataCenters? 
<br>c)	Raise the money to pay the bills anyway?
<br><br>Or do you find a way that both saves money & makes managing it easy? 
<br><br>By introducing Spot Instances into the mix and deploying Auto-Scaling, you can do just that.
<br><br><b>Spot Instances</b><br><br>
<br><br>To the uninitiated, Spots Instances are the unused or dormant compute resources which AWS provides to bidders at much lower prices than normal instances. On an average these prices can be 1/8th or 1/10th of normal instances, and the variation is totally dependent on market demand where AWS users place bids.
It works like any other auction market, in that AWS sets a base price and users put forth bids at prices higher that the base price. The highest bidders win & it’s smooth sailing after that.
Except it isn’t, because Spot Instances are temporary allocations of unused resources. Spots are yours so as long as someone else doesn’t bid a higher price for them or there isn’t increase in demand for normal instances. These are the termination policies exercised by AWS, and they are the reason why a lot of people don’t opt for Spot Instances in their mix.

Cross-origin resource sharing is a mechanism by which resources such as images, fonts, JavaScript can be shared with the domains other than the resources are present on.
In short, it enables web browsers to support secure cross site data transfers. A web page may have embedded images, stylesheets, scripts and videos from any domain.
However Ajax are restricted to the same domain as the parent web page.
This default behaviour of permitting scripts contained in a first web page to access data in a second web page, only if both web pages have the same domain is called the Same Origin Policy.

So, two requests originated from pages example.com and example.com/settings have same origin.
While requests originated from http://www.example.com, https://www.example.com, http://www.anotherexample.com, http://another.example.com have different origins.

CORS is a mechanism by which a browser and a server can interact to determine if cross-origin requests are to be allowed or not.
It allows for more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin requests, but it is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests.

Same-origin-policy protects us from malicious attacks, but sometimes this capability is desired, here comes the role of Cross Origin Resource Sharing mechanism.
The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing standard works by adding new HTTP headers that allow servers to describe the set of origins that are permitted to read that information using a web browser.
The CORS standard describes new HTTP headers which provide browsers and servers a way to request remote URLs only when they have permission.
When a CORS-compatible browser attempts to make a cross-origin request, the browser send the request with an HTTP header- 'Origin'.
The value of this header is the domain where the request came from.
Now, when a page from http://www.alice.com wants to access a user’s data in http://www.bar.com (yes, cross-origin it is!), Origin header will have value ‘http://www.alice.com'.
Now the server at bob.com may respond with another header called Access-Control-Allow-Origin (ACAO) with its value set to allowed origins such as http://www.alice.com or an error page would be served.

Note that the ACAO header is being set by the server we need resource from i.e.
www.bob.com, not the original web application server from which the request was sent i.e.
www.alice.com.

So Cross Domain Resource Sharing is to be allowed if you want to access resources from other domains.
But what if you are hosting your website on 127.0.0.0 and all assets needed for the web application are available there itself and your browser gives “CORS error: CORS request failed”.

There are many ways by which you can allow Cross Origin Resource Sharing and people have talked about them extensively e.g.
configuring ACAO header tags.
But you are running your application on localhost and all the resources needed are available there only.
Where is the catch here?
First understand that it is NOT a Cross Origin issue as your application does not demand any data from any place other than your own machine.
Then why CORS error by the browser, eh?
Go, check your routes end to end.
Lets suppose, you are working on a RAILS application.
How a route is resolved in a RAILS application? Lets look at the process step by step-
Your rails server is running on 127.0.0.0:3000 on your machine and you hit 127.0.0.0:3000/ in address bar of your browser  in your machine.
It goes to your server running at given pair of ip address-port number and asks to render root route of your application which in turn resolves it to a controller function using your config/routes.rb file.

Now, suppose you click on “settings" button on your browser which is currently displaying your application home page which would take you to “/settings” path of your application.
But nothing happens.
You open the JavaScript console in your browser and find an error “CORS error: CORS request failed” instead.
At this very step, you should go check all the possible places where you could have defined paths for your application in your front end.
What are those places? Where you submit your forms or handle a click event to go to a different path.
You might be using AJAX to send XMLHttpRequest objects and get data from the server.
If you are using AJAX to handle your requests to server, go to /app/assets/javascripts folder and check all the request handling you have written, specially check the paths you have sent requests to.
Even a single extra “/“ in your path will cause the Origin header of your request to change.
And before you will understand, it will make your request a cross-origin one (remember Origin as a set of protocol, ip address and port number).
Your browser won't find your domain in permitted origins and it will give you a Cross Origin Request Failed error.
So, go change that syntax error and your application should work just fine running on your localhost.

So, now you know what CORS is? And what to do when your browser throws a CORS error next time, specially when you are running rails server on your localhost, right? :)

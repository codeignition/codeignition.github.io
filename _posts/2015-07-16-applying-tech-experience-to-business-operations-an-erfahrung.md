When we started CodeIgnition, I knew it was going to be a bumpy ride for me. I was to handle Operations and Finance which I had never done in my life. My past experiences in these fields included getting money from ATM and maintaining the household grocery stock. With little to no knowledge & exposure, I was rather perplexed about handling finance and operations of a company which is going to operate globally. All that was favouring me was Ajey and my heart which kept saying "Yes, you can do it!" 

I was a developer who knew how to code, knew stories, implementation and nothing beyond that. And here I started with lots of paperwork and lots of reading. On top of it, this was a very isolated role. A complete background job. It is like Salt. It goes unnoticed when it’s done right, but go even a little off track and all hell breaks loose.

For me, it was like having a baby. That feeling of not being prepared. I kept reading and learning. Some of it worked, while some felt like "Oh! It doesn't suit our business!" Like in case of baby, people keep making suggestions in hindsight and you keep feeling "Oh! Why didn’t I think of this?!" At times you feel pathetic about not knowing everything. 

But eventually I figured out that operations and finance can also be handled the way you develop software. Prioritise, Estimate, Iterate. Priorities, Estimate, Iterate. And so it goes. Only difference is you need to do Requirement Gathering and Quality Control as well. 

So I started applying what I learned at my previous job (ThoughtWorks) and previous business (Natakhat, a pre-primary school in Pune). Over the last year or so I have learned quite a few things about finance & operations by applying my technology experience, namely:

1. **Read the documentation.** In my case it was books. I prepared my reading list. I started wondering about questions - What does a COO do? What does a CFO do? What is expected out of this role. What are tax requirements for setting up companies in India, what tax registrations do we need to do? What taxes apply where? To get all these answers you need to read documentation. You need to keep doing that. There is nothing like reading and learning so much.

2. **Estimation** - do it like stories! You can’t run a business if you can’t forecast income and expenditure. I asked this question to myself and Ajey. As always he refused to help and said that's the job of COO, figure it out. In the absence of spoon-feeding, I started making simple spread sheet where I put billing rates and expected billing hours, then started putting expenditures, applied some developer short cuts and voila - 10 hours later I was with a formula driven excel sheet which talks about revenue and expenses. I then tweaked it with exchange rates, number of employees, utilisation percentages and billing rate and came up with an optimistic number - then ran past with Ajey and then others. We iterated - and that sheet is now a golden rule book for me.

3. **You will lose clients, but don't lose your sight.** The day you start working with a client, you know you will lose them one day. There are few ramp downs that happen in a very projected way while some will stop suddenly. Our business is DevOps consulting, I am proud of my co-founders, they are damn good at it. They know it very well that the better we are at automation, the quicker we finish it! Sometimes it just so happens that our estimation go wrong and we finish the work earlier. For example Shobhit finished a 2 week gig, as estimated by the client, in only 2 days! What do you do in such cases? You depend on percentage billable hours. You look at everyone’s billable percentages and try to average out over the year. You are likely to embark on a bumpy ride financially for a while, but it’s gonna be alright! Keep your eye on the goal. Be strategic when it comes to finances, not tactical.

4. **Whatever has to go wrong, will go wrong.** Those "Oh sh*t" moments! They occur every other day in operations and finances. First week of every month I am busy billing and sending invoices to clients. Second and third week I keep worrying about revenue two months down the line and into the next quarter. Luckily at some point I magically figured out that doing an AOP iteration every week helps me figure out what's likely going to happen down the line 3 months. 

At the beginning of the year I prepare AOP with some prediction on client number and billable hours. But that is just a prediction. Projects will shutdown, people might leave and delivery may hamper - but my job is to not let panic settle into whole company. I tell my co-founders whether we are on track or not and give them as much early warning as possible - especially to Ajey. A Golden rule of accounting which I’ve learnt is to be conservative on income projection and be liberal in expenses projection. Because whatever has to go wrong, will go wrong!


Doing all the operations & finances seemed daunting when we started, but now it’s fun, challenging, and very rewarding. I don't spend a lot of time in office, but I do get to play a role larger than that of an admin, a janitor and an accountant combined! I couldn’t ask for more and I will say it’s a perfectly balanced life for me! Raising CodeIgnition is just a proud feeling I have.

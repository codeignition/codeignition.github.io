The STARTUP word has always fascinated me.In the recent times, all I could read or hear was about a new startup coming up. We have got a startup for every industry and they are thriving like never before.
Startup Culture is fast spreading its wings around and fortunately, I  also got a chance to be a part of the  “startup culture”. I joined Code Ignition which is a Devops Startup still in its nascent stages doing some amazing work. The transition from an MNC to a Startup is worth a mention. 
Startups are for those who wish to LEARN and WORK.There is learning at every step you take. It is about working with the latest technology trends emerging each day. Coming from an MNC to a startup is a huge cultural change. In an MNC, everything is done for you starting with your work station to your machine, everything is predefined. You are given a place to sit, a team to work with and a project. Everything is FIXED.

The STARTUP world is a lot different, here you have to be responsible for your very existence in it. You need to arrange everything for yourself and also if need be for everyone else too. You don’t have to report to a particular manager or have to work with a set of people already assigned with you. Here, you have to work on multiple projects, there is no team but everyone , every single person is involved. It’s amazing how, each one of us learns from one another. 
In an MNC, 90% of the people are just doing their work not knowing how actually a project functions, here you have the opportunity of exploring the business side of the project as well. In the STARTUP environment you are free to make your own rules and you have to be responsible enough to stick by them. Each day is a new day and each development is mutually exclusive from the other. In a startup the focus is more on working on cutting edge technologies, and one has to keep oneself updated with whats going on in that arena.
In the initial years of your career, STARTUP’s are the place to be in.  You get the feel of doing something each day , at the end of the day you are happy doing something instead of nothing. You work across various different platforms and different clients all at the same time. 
In an MNC there is a lack of absolute power and active decision making unless you hold an extremely high rank , whilst in a Startup you are made to take the best decision for the problem concerned irrespective of the position, the only thing you need to have strong baseline for it. Everyone is at the same level and works as a small team motivating, helping and moving forward with one another. 

A usual day starts with a company wide “STANDUP” in which everyone states about the agenda for the day and what they have worked on. This keeps everyone informed of whats happening around. There is something new in everyday and it is the driving factor for starting on a new set of problems and challenges. 

I am glad I took this decision to join a startup as I always wanted to explore more and work across different technologies. And this is just the start with a lot of options to be explored.

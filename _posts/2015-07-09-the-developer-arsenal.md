I have been thinking recently about all the experiences and people that have helped shape how I think and behave today. I often talk with great pride about my friends, colleagues & mentors who have influenced me in a very positive way. People like Roy Singham, Rohit Bansal, Sitaraman Dharmarajan, Markku Koppinen, Rebecca Parsons, Chaitanya Nadkarny to name but a few.

And the one thing common to all of them is that they recommended books that I should read. Books they felt I would like and would be helpful to me, and boy were they right. 

So I thought I should come up with a list of books myself. These are top 5 books I recommend everyone in my office should read, as well as anyone who is interested even a little bit in technology.

Here we go, in no particular order:

1. **Passionate Programmer**:  I read this book back when it was titled ‘My job went to India’ & on the cover there was a guy holding a placard saying “will code for food”. It looked like it would be comedy fiction, but I started reading and discovered gems in every chapter. Things like ‘get a mentor’ followed by the advice that you should become a mentee for yourself! 

Overall this book is a very good read, teaching you how to shape your career like a personal business and be successful at it. I could really relate to this book because I started as a graphics designer and ended up programming.

2. **Mythical Man Month**: “Adding more people to solve software problem at a very late stage in project" is completely acceptable idea in 60% organizations around the world. Surprised? Well that’s what the whole ‘man month’ calculation leads to. 

This is a fascinating book to read as it plays out more like an experience report and makes concepts like ‘No silver bullet’, ‘progress tracking, measuring and monitoring’ and ‘surgical team’ seem pretty natural and unnerving.

3. **Refactoring**: My ex-colleague Martin Fowler has written many books and the way he captures & articulates his experiences makes each book a work of art. This book captures many of his experiences in refactoring in large scale IT projects at ThoughtWorks and elsewhere. If you want to learn how to keep producing efficient code, then this book is a must-read. 

I can’t really do justice reviewing this book, so just go to his site and read up on it: http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html

4. **Pragmatic Programmer**: Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt have collected pearls of wisdom and bottled them neatly in this thoroughly enjoyable yet immensely helpful book. I will never forget ‘boiling frog’, ‘stone soup’ and ‘broken windows’ which always remind me to act now or pay the price 6 months down the line. 

A book full of such ‘Aha’ moments which you can correlate to your experiences very easily. Or if you’ve yet to experience them, then you’ll be able to spot the correlation when it does happen.

5. **Test Drive Development**: I am constantly surprised by the number of people who haven't read this book even though it’s been a staple for years. Kent Beck packs well-articulated examples, reasons & descriptions into a pretty compact that helps us understand why you need to write code and how business benefits from it more than your tech team. 

So that wraps up my 5 book recommendations for programmers, developers and especially my colleagues. I plan to write another blog post soon on what to read when you are running a technology business company, but more on it later.

I have been thinking for a while, I had been given reading list my many amazing people - and that helped me shaped up the way I think and behave today.
Many of time I talk with pride about my mentors, friends and colleagues who have influenced me in a very positive way -
Few of them are Roy Singham, Rohit Bansal, Sitaraman Dharmarajan, Markku Koppinen, Rebecca Parsons, Chaitanya Nadkarny... and there are many more which I can not mention.
But these came up with one list which is pretty common, they told me to go read a book.
So I thought I should come up with a book list - which everyone in my office should read and every one who is little bit interested in technology should read as well. So here I go.

1. **Passionate Programmer**:
I read this book once when it was called "My job went to India" - A guys holding a placard saying "will code for food".
It sounded like a fiction. But voila, start reading the book and you will discover gems in every lesson,
and things like get a mentor and next moment Chad is telling you to be come mentee for your self.
A good read, talks how you can shape your career as personal business and be successful at it.
I could related to it more because I started as Graphics Designer and ended up becoming a programmer.

2. **Mythical Man Month**:
"Adding more people to solve software problem at a very late stage in project" is completely acceptable idea in 60% organisation around world.
Surprised? well that's what whole "man month" calculation leads to. Read this book, it talks about.
It's an experience report and concepts of "No silver bullet", "progress tracking, measuring and monitoring" and "surgical team" become pretty natural and un-nerving.

3. **Refactoring**:
My ex-colleague Martin Fowler has written many books, and each of them is a work of art. The art of articulation of experiences all around him.
This book is gist of many may refactoring happened at large scale IT projects in ThoughtWorks or else where, you must read it,
you must know what does it mean by keep producing efficient code the more about this book here - http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html
because I am no one compared to Martin to even put comment on his work. Its just great!

4. **Pragmatic Programmer**:
Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt have bottled up marbles of wisdom, and handed that over to you.
A thoroughly enjoyable read is all about. I can never forget "boiling frog" or "stone soup".
The broken windows are always remind me about act now or get your self screwed in next 6 months.
A book full of those "aha" moments when you can correlate it immediately or if you have not experienced it yet, it gives you at least the ability to spot and match the pattern.

5. **Test Drive Development**:
I am surprised that how many people I interact with haven't read this book even after years.
Kent Beck packs examples and reasons into a pretty compact book with articulated descriptions and reasons.
This helps us understand why do you need to write code and how business benefits from it more than your tech team.

So these are 5 books, I would recommend to programmers, developers and my colleagues!
I hope to write another blog post on what to read when you are running a technology business company. More on it later.

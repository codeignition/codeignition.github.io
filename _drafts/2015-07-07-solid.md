## Single Responsibility Priniciple -
*A class should have only one reason to change, thus it should perform
only one job.*

Probably the most intuitive and easy to understand, but hard in
practice. Its application in code does wonders regarding simplicity and
readability.

Take a look at the code below, we have defined a class `person`, which has
3 attributes. One of them is `email`, which needs to be verified.

    class Person{
      name: string ;
      address: string;
      email: string;
      validate email(){
        //validation logic
      }
    }

One might want to verify the `email` in his own way, whether its syntax
or domain or whatever. These changes do not affect the job of `person`
class, since it is supposed to define a `person` object. If it is also
validating the email, it is then violating SRP.

So, we take the validation step outside, create a new class. That will
leave us with `person` class with only one job - defining a person
object. That should be it.

    class Email{
      email: string;
      validate email(){
        //validation logic
      }
    }

    class Person{
      name: string;
      address: string;
      email: Email;
    }

SRP has following advantages

- it makes refactoring really easy.
- imposes a great deal of structure on the code.
- naming things, which is actually tough, is made easier since classes
  now have one simple job, so one can name them accordingly which can
  make it clear what it does.

Let's move on to the next one.

## Open/Closed Principle

*Modules should be open for extension, but closed for modification.*

Let's take a look at an example -

    class Rectangle{
      width;
      height;
    }

    class AreaCalculator{
      calculateArea(){
        //calculate area
      }
    }

Now suppose, you are instructed that `AreaCalculator` class should
calculate area of a `circle` as well. You might think that's not a big
deal.

You make one `circle` class and edit the `AreaCalculator` accordingly.

    class Circle{
      radius;
    }

    class AreaCalculator(shape){
      calculateArea(){
        if(shape == rectangle) return width * height;
        else return pie*radius*radius
      }
    }

Yay, you did it. But now, you are instructed to add one for `triangle`
as well. Well this is getting bad now, you will now edit the function,
adding another if-else will result in complex code. You do know we don't
like complex code.

So, how do we get it right? Well, OCP wants us to write code, which are
closed for modification but open for extension. It wants you to separate
the behaviours of the system, such that utterly intrinsic behaviours are
behind a wall, that can't be touched and the remainings that are
variable and might change a lot are on other side of the wall. The base
class is behind the wall, untouchable and all the dependencies point
towards the base class.

To resolve the above code, we will be using `interfaces`. Let's see how
that works out.

    interface Area{
      calculateArea(){}
    }

    class Rectangle : Area{
      width;
      height;

      calculateArea(){
        return width*height;
      }
    }

    class Circle : Area{
      radius;

      calculateArea(){
        return pie*radius*radius;
      }
    }

Now, even if you are told to find area of `triangle`, you will simply add
another class, implement the `Area` interface and override the function,
without modifying the existing code. Neat huh.

##Liskov Substitution

*Objects of base class can be replaced by objects of derived class.*

Let's talk about shapes. There are quadrilaterals, rectangles, squares etc.
Let's take up rectangles and squares. A `rectangle` class would posses
`width` and `height` as its attributes and some functions like `area`,
`perimeter`.

    class Rectangle{
      width;
      height;

      setWidth(){};
      setHeight(){};
    }

Now, a square is a rectangle, right. So, a `square` can inherit from a
`rectangle`.

    class Square extends Rectangle{
    }

Good enough? No. We just violated the Liskov Substitution principle.

Think about it, a `rectangle` has two attributes: `width` and `height`, while a
`square` needs just one: `side`. `Square` needs only one variable, but it will
inherit two. A `rectangle` would have methods for `set height` and `set width`
but a `square` won't need those both.

Now, there is a design issue at stake.

Understand that IsA is not inheritance. Square is a rectangle, can't be
more true. But it's in terms of `geometry`, the same can't be said about
those two while programming. It is an example of bad design. A better
design would be to keep rectangle and square different and inheriting
from a shape class.

Liskov Substitution principle saves us from such bad software designs,
apply this and you won't make such mistakes again.

One more example is of circle and ellipse. I am leaving it on you to
think about it.

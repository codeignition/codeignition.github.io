<a href=”socialmind.in” target=”_blank”>SocialMind</a> is a simple social media collaboration tool that lets users share & co-manage social media accounts with each other. 

Developed here at CodeIgnition, SocialMind is an open-source tool & anyone can use it. We plan to learn, iterate and release more awesome features in the days ahead. More on that later in this post.

**Starting with Twitter**

SocialMind’s beta version has Twitter integration. Any Twitter user can sign in to their account, approve the SocialMind app & share that account with other Twitter users. 

If you are part of a media or brand team, or a group of collaborators from a common Twitter account, then you should try <a href=”socialmind.in” target=”_blank”>SocialMind</a>.

Some of the features the beta release contains:
* Sign up using just the Twitter account. No long forms or any other details needed.
* Invite collaborators with email. Invited users just need to click on invitation link & sign up using any Twitter account, even their personal one.
* Single click switch between accounts you collaborate on.
* Compose new tweets & post directly from SocialMind.

**Future Releases**

* Twitter features like reply, retweet, favorites & more
* Keep track of tweets & retweets made by collaborators on SocialMind
* Insights such as daily new followers & un-followers stats & contribution analysis

Try <a href=”socialmind.in” target=”_blank”>SocialMind</a> now, it’s open source. Tweet your feedback and thoughts to <a href=”https://twitter.com/codeignition”>@CodeIgnition</a> or let us know in the comments below.

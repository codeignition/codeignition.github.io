####Lets introduce you to a guy named “Mat”.
Mat is a software engineer. He started his career in an IT firm working on a software product.
Over time he started working on different technologies and implementing it using different languages.
He enjoyed coding as it was all about logic. Ideally everything that he was working on should have
behaved the way it was implemented. But every time or the other, sometimes even in the middle of the
night, he used to get calls to fix the production issues. No matter how thoroughly he was with testing
his code, it would still break. There were some common reasons like manual changes on the server,
difference between the production and test environment, restricted access to troubleshooting information.
Because of all these reasons Mat was very frustrated with Bob.

####Who is “Bob”?
Bob is the enabler. Whenever code breaks in production, call Bob; new test environment needs to be setup,
call Bob; you need the latest database backup, or you are having access issues or server needs to be managed,
Bob was all over the place. Everyday he will start his morning with huge number of open tickets. Tickets
that were related to granting access, application deployment, database backup or server management.
Everyday Bob worked very hard just to keep up with the requests. Requests from the developers. Every time
and then developers want to try something or the other, they raise tickets for everything and everything is
urgent. Frequently deployment fails in production just because developers did not take the environment
dependencies into account when they wrote their code. The whole build cycle stops when somebody pushes
a buggy code and everybody has to wait for their code checkin until the issue gets resolved.  Everyday
Bob had to give access of some or the other server because developers wanted to “check something”. His life
was hard because of the lack of structure and so many other reasons.

####Lets introduce a third person “Stuart”.
Stuart manages a very big; high traffic website. He implements his infrastructure as code and automates everything
which makes it completely immutable. He effectively collaborates with the developers to put the operations needs
before hand. To improve the process of software delivery he automates the continuous deployment as a part of CI pipeline,
which allows the software to get built and tested continuously and at the same time helps developers with the feedback.
This process adds reliability and repeatability at production. In his company everyone has a smile on the release date.
His monitoring and logging setup collects all the statistics about the servers and applications at one place. Therefore
nobody is allowed and required to log into the servers. His infra is very reliable and hardly gives any surprises, as
everything is implemented as code and everything is trackable through version control. Thus, everybody in his company
can worry less about the infrastructure and focus more on the product.

I have been the above 3 people at different point in time.
I started my carrier as Mat. Working on a chunk of a big piece of software did not give me the exposure to the overall
infrastructural needed for the complete application. Any infrastructural need was fulfilled by some Bob . I never
participated or showed any interest in working with Bob’s as I had always thought that his and my work was completely independent.

During one summer vacation, I went on a trip with few of my very good friends. There,
I came across this term “Devops”. When I searched about it over the internet the first thing that I looked up was the
wiki page and the words I came across in the first 2 lines were **communication, collaboration, integration, automation,
and measurement of cooperation. Seriously !!**

That was quite some amount of motivation. I kept looking more about it. I was somewhat getting the philosophy behind it but
still the practicality was missing. A little more struggle gave me a fair amount of understanding.
Next thing was that I joined Codeignition, the Devops guys. To begin with, I was a little apprehensive because it was very
different or at least it looked very different from what I was doing earlier.

Very early into devops Bob came into my devops life when I started working on a legacy infrastructure of one of our client.
Job at hand was to restructure everything into a more modern day infrastructure. This could not have happened in a day.
The earlier sysadmin used to do everything with a shell script or manually by logging into servers. Examples are like
deployment by manually logging into the live servers, shell script to spawn KVMs, handcrafting the firewall configurations,
script for backup stuff and giving access by manually adding keys and what not. It was quite a legacy one can pass. I used
to spend all my day in resolving the tickets with very little time to put into infrastructure improvement. It was a vicious
circle. But slowly we did put everything into place. I’ll say I saw just a glimpse of typical operations and it was ugly.

Now it’s some time being Stuart. Adoption of devops culture has changed the way software industries used to run. With the
emphasis on the business development of our clients and productivity of their employees we adopt various tools and technologies.
Configuration management tools like Puppet, Ansible, Chef and Salt helps automate and orchestrate the infrastructure. With the
focus on continuous incremental improvements, automated test driven techniques, automated deployments and early feedback we use
continuous integration and continuous delivery methodology and the tools we use are jenkins, teamcity and Go CI.
Logging tools like ELK and Papertrail allow users to analyze all the logs at one central location. Monitoring tools like datadog
monitors the health of the infrastructure but more importantly provides the profiles and statistical data of complete infrastructure
when tested under load. With the help of so many quality open source tools we are continuously building effective and reliable infrastructure.

The transition that I saw is mesmerising. A huge transition is still going on in this industry. Adoption of microservice architectural
pattern with technologies like containers are no less than a revolution. With open source world contributing so much into this field,
the future seems to be much more exciting.

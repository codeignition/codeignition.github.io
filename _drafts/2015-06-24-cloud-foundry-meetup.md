We at codeignition love open Source and use open source tools & technologies pretty heavily, and we give

back to the community in whatever way we can. Whether it’s code contributions, infrastructure

support, or helping organize events, conferences and meetups that give good  platforms for developers, users & business runners to

meet, discuss, learn and engage.

Events like conferences, meetups, hackathons are great opportunities to dive deep into these tools &

platforms and meet the people who build & grow them. At CodeIgnition we have experience organizing

RubyConf, DevOps Days, Gophercon & local Ruby community meetups. So when Ronak Banka from Rakuten, Tokyo

got in touch with us recently seeking support in hosting a meetup for Cloud Foundry in NCR, we were

game.

Swiftly getting into action, we put the word out and scheduled the meetup for 13th June 2015 at our

office. Short & sweet, the meetup was for 2 hours with the following agenda:

* Ronak Banka – His talk was an introduction to Cloud Foundry

* Irfan Shah & Neel Mathews from IBM gave a talk on IBM Bluemix’s services & ecosystem and how &

why Bluemix is banking on Cloud Foundry

Although small in scale, our first Clound Foundry meetup was an exciting experience as it gave us

developers & users a chance to meet each other and learn new ways to use the platform in the products

we build & the problems we solve on a daily basis.
